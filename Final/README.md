INFO-664: FINAL PROJECT â€” College: The Cliff Notes
==============================================================

Diane Ferrera - December, 2021
--------------------------------

For my INFO-664 final project I explored a variety of data related to higher education.  I created my visualizations in Python using Plotly.  I used Plotly Express to embed my visualizations into my HTML, while maintaining the ineractivity. Although not yet posted to my wenpage, I also created maps using GeoPandas. (The code is included in this GitHub folder.) My page is still very a work in progress, and I hope to add more data and visualizations in the coming weeks.
